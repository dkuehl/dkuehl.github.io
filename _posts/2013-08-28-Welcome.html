Hey! So after a long and overdue time, I'm finally rolling out a site and try and learn some new things on the way. I had a friend of mine mention that he uses Jekyll for blogging a few months ago and after a couple hours playing around tonight with it, I really do enjoy what I am seeing. I hope you stay with me as I start a new journey!
